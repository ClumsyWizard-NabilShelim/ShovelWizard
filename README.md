# ShovelWizard
Shovel Wizard is my second game jam gam and was a submission for the Brackeys Game Jam 2020.1. The theme of the jam was 'Holes' (got the pun?) and it lasted for a week. It's also my first ever puzzle platformer.... well, more of a platformer but you know. Its a game where you can create portals and using those you have to solve puzzles.

 Made using:
  - Unity Game Engine.
  - C# programming engine.
  - Bfxr for sound effects.
  - Photoshop for pixel art.
